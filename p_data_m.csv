"1","After the recording session, each word was segmented using Praat software. First, voice
stimuli were normalised according to peak amplitude by means of a Praat script. Audacity
software was used for noise reduction. Then, stimuli were cut at the beginning and at the
end of each word, using Praat software. Mean pitch, intensity and duration were subsequently
calculated for each condition (","F0_min, F0_max, Intensity_M, Words Dur(ms)","For pitch it is also reported the minimum and mazinum F0.

"2","The estimation
of the prosodic speech profile was performed analyzing
the variations in the height trajectory and pitch
perception (prosodic peaks and valleys) of the F0 of the vocalic syllable nuclei that contain voice signals, on a
peak intensity delimited -3dB and -9dB to left and right,
respectively, in order to represent the melodic movements
perceived by the human ear. The value of the
left limit (–3dB) eliminates most of the microprosodic
disturbances and stylizes the beginning of the syllable,
while the right (–9dB) limit preserves the variations in
tone of accented vowels","Intensity(db), pause rate>300ms, mean F0, f0 sd, f0 range, syllabic dynamics, prosodic peaks, prosodic valleys, intra-syllabic trajectory, inter-syllabic trajectory, phonation tarjectory","They report also f0 range (ST), prosodics peaks and valleys, inta syllabic and phonation trajectory.
